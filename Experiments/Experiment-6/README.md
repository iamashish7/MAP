After finding out [node-hours, queue-state, load, nodes] works best.

Experimented on same set of parameters for all predictors.
Measured PPE,AAE(Experiemnt.xls), maximum of all error both PPE and absolute error(Experiment-max_error.xls), minimum of all error both PPE and absolute error (Experiment-min_error.xls), median of all error both PPE and absolute error (Experiment-median_error.xls) and run time of experiments (Experiment-time.xls)
